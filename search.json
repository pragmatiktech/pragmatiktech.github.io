Headsets run the gamut of rates from the really inexpensive (under $100) ‚Äústudent‚Äù headsets to mid-range headsets (around $400) to the top-of-the-line active noise canceling headsets ($800 - $1,300).\nMy personal favorite is the Bose A30, but at $1,299, it is the most expensive headset out there.\nAnother good option for an active noise canceling headset is the Lightspeed¬†Zulu¬†3.\nIf you‚Äôre looking for something a little more ‚Äúmid-range‚Äù, you could purchase a passive noise canceling headset such as the David Clark H10-13S, which retails for a more wallet-friendly $360.\nI have found that among pilots, headsets are like religions ‚Äì you‚Äôll find the ‚ÄúBose camp‚Äù and the ‚ÄúLightspeed camp‚Äù. So, pick one that works for you and use it for your training.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen ordering a headset, make sure you order one with dual GA plugs or fixed-wing, 2 plug, battery powered.

This publication (previously called the ‚ÄúAirports and Facility Directory or A/FD) that gives you the details of all the airports in a region as well as the navigation aids and other information.

Expressed in statute miles.\nCeiling: How high above the ground are the bases of the clouds. Expressed in feet.\nWinds:\n\nSpeed: How strong are the winds. Expressed in knots.\nDirection: Are the winds directly down the runway or is there a significant crosswind component?\nGusts: Are the winds steady or are there gusts?\n\nAdverse Conditions: These would include things like turbulence, thunderstorms, icing, etc. They‚Äôre not as relevant for flying in SoCal (since we hardly get any real weather), but they‚Äôre important to keep in mind.\n\n\n\nWeather Minimums for A Pre-solo Student\nFor a pre-solo student, I like to keep things fairly ‚Äúeasy‚Äù. As the student gets closer to solo, I add more challenging situations in order to help the student understand (appreciate?) how even small changes in the weather could make their flights ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù.\n\nVisibility: 5 SM. Can be 3 SM if staying in the pattern at KEMT.\nCeiling: 3,500 feet. Can be 1,500 feet if staying in the pattern at KEMT.\nWinds: 5 knots. As we progress toward solo, this will increase to 10 knots, with a crosswind component of 2 knots.\nAdverse Conditions: No turbulence greater than light. Obviously, no thunderstorms in the vicinity. Light rain or rain showers are OK ‚Äì they are irritating during preflight and can make landing a little challenging.",

They will evaluate your ability to control the aircraft in all phases of flight, communicate effectively with air traffic control, operate safely within the environment of other airports, and demonstrate adequate aeronautical decision making abilities.\nOnce you pass the pre solo cross country phase check, you are ready to fly the required solo cross country flights.

After that, we will start the engines, get the weather, and taxi out to the runway. We conduct a check of the engine and the flight controls, and then we get our departure clearance and we‚Äôre off to soar in the sky!\nI generally take students to the Long Beach area for the demo flight. It is a short (15-20 minute) flight. Perhaps, more important, the air is cooler than further inland and turbulence is minimal. It is also scenic and a lot of fun to see the ships in the harbor during our flight.\nYou will get to take off the aircraft, level off at altitude, and fly us to the our destination and back. I will always be there supporting you, communicating with air traffic control (ATC), watching for other traffic, and making sure that we have a safe flight. I will take the controls during our approach and landing.\nAt the end of the flight, I will sign the first entry in your log book, and you are on your way to becoming a pilot.",
