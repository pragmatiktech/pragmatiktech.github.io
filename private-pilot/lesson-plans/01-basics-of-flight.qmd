## Introduction

The first flight introduces the student to the structure of typical flight lessons and allows them to build a relationship with their instructor.

Risk management and the importance of checklists are emphasized.

## Objectives

At the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:

1. Discuss the structure of a typical flight lesson.
2. Use the preflight checklist to preflight the aircraft.
3. Understand, and explain, the various items on the checklist and relate potential failures to the safety of flight.
4. Perform a pre-takeoff check (aka *runup*).
5. Perform a normal takeoff and climb to the practice area.
6. Demonstrate basic flight maneuvers: climbs, descents, straight and level flight, and turns.
7. Divide attention between external references and flight instruments.
