Thank you for visiting my web site. My name is Charath Ranganathan and I am a CFII based in sunny Southern California. I teach at the [Aero Association of California Institute of Technology](https://aacit.org/) (AACIT), often known as the "Caltech/JPL Flying Club."

As a lifelong aviation enthusiast, avid flight simmer, and AvGeek, I am happiest when I'm in the air. I consider it a privilege to guide you in your aviation journey.

My goal is to make this site one of the most sought-after resources for those embarking on their aviation journey. The site and its contents will always be free.

So, please click through the resources on the site. And, if you are interested, please sign up to be notified of site updates. I promise to never sell your information to anyone.
