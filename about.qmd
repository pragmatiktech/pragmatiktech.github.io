Charath Ranganathan is the CTO at Crowdbotics, where they are revolutionizing the software development lifecycle (SDLC) through their AI-based code-to-spec system.

Charath has been an avid coder for over 4 decades, having started with BASIC on a Casio Handheld computer and then on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum in the early 1980s. He is a polyglot programmer with experience in a wide range of programming languages from COBOL and FORTRAN, through Java and Python, to Go.

Charath is also very interested in embedded systems programming, especially in TinyGo and Micropython. You can view his tutorials on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@pragmatiktech).

When he is not working or coding, Charath can be found at his local airport, where he is an FAA-certified flight instructor with the [Caltech/JPL Flying Club](https://aacit.org/).
