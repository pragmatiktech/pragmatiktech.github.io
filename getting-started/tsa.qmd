Prior to beginning flight training, all flight instructors are required to verify that the student is a citizen of the United States and endorse your log book with that information. We are also required to maintain a copy of your proof of citizenship and the endorsement.

The most common form of citizenship proof is a U.S. passport. So, please plan on bringing your passport with you to our lesson.

## Non-US Citizens

If you are not a U.S. citizen, you will be required to submit an application for TSA screening at the [Flight Training Security Program (FTSP)](https://www.fts.tsa.dhs.gov/home) and be approved prior to beginning training. 

If you are not a U.S. Citizen, please let me know as soon as possible and I can guide you through the process of TSA approval. It takes about 6 weeks and costs about $250 to get your TSA approval.

We cannot begin flight training until your FTSP application has been approved.
